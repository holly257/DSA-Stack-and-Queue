1. Create a stack class
    - Walk through the Stack class in the curriculum and understand it well. Then write a Stack
    - class with its core functions (push, pop) from scratch.
    - Create a stack called starTrek and add Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and Scotty to the stack.

2. Useful methods for a stack
    - Using the Stack class above, implement the following helper functions outside of the class:
    - peek(): allows you to look at the top of the stack without removing it
    - isEmpty(): allows you to check if the stack is empty or not
    - display(): to display the stack - what is the 1st item in your stack?
    - Remove McCoy from your stack and display the stack

3. Check for palindromes using a stack
    - A palindrome is a word, phrase, or number that is spelled the same forward and backward. For example,
    - “dad” is a palindrome; “A man, a plan, a canal: Panama” is a palindrome if you take out the spaces and
    - ignore the punctuation; and 1,001 is a numeric palindrome. We can use a stack to determine whether or
    - not a given string is a palindrome.
    - Write an algorithm that uses a stack to determine whether a given input is palindrome or not. Use the following template as a starting point.
